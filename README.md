Multi-Layer Perceptron Algorithm for Image Classification of Simple Shapes: This project aims to design a neural network to classify simple shapes.

Machine learning algorithms are used to classify images in many industries, whether it be road detection in autonomous driving, diagnosing medical conditions in medical imaging, or facial recognition for security services. The capabilities of machine learning services for image classification vary depending both on the hardware of the machines performing the calculations and the software or code that is being performed. Learned from this introduction to machine learning, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, while capable of image classification, are best utilized on simple, small images. Accordingly, this project examines the image classification capabilities of neural networks by attempting to create an algorithm that will classify 4 different simple shapes (square, rectangle, circle, triangle).
The idea behind selecting this problem is to create a fully-automated activity for children to learn how to draw and identify different shapes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have struggled to both entertain their children while working from home and to ensure their children are getting the education they would otherwise get in pre-pandemic times at their regular schools. The solution of an app providing a fun, interactive environment to both teach and practice drawing shapes will provide a first cut solution to keep children occupied and learning at the same time.


# Structure of the Repository

The structure of the repository is very simple. Here is a list of the folders and their contents:

1). Code - Contains the code

2). Images - Contains the database of images used in our code

3). Final-Group-Presentation - Contains the final presentation of the group

4). ML Group2 Final Report - The final report of the group
